# Defog App

This project was put together utilizing ChatGPT.
It is built with reactjs and uses the tomorrow.io weather api

I have been learning about using ChatGPT for getting an idea quickly realized and then modifiying it to meet my needs.

With this project I wanted to be a little more granular with the information I gave to ChatGPT and see how close to a final product I could get. And for what I was looking to create it is pretty close. I wasn't looking for anything pretty, I just wanted to search some weather datapoints and decide what method would be best to keep my windshield clear from fog using that data. We could drill down more into what method to use and make it more sophisticated, but this was something that I wanted to put together for my personal use; it didn't need to be revolutionary. Here is the original [conversation with ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/27b4888e-2ad9-4822-97e7-b146d9a17ae1)

I had already had a previous conversation with ChatGPT about finding a weather api. It was structured very similarly to the conversation linked above.

Use this like any other basic react app with an api: clone the repo; `npm install`, update the `API_Key` variable with your tomorrow.io api key in `weather-info-component.jsx` file, and `npm start`
